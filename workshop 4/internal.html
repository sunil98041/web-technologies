       <p>Pravash Karki. In this lecture session we learned about CSS i.e. Cascading Style sheet and how to implement and execute it on HTML, as well as to make our web page more attractive. After and all we had a commercial break of two hours and I am planning to practice CSS on my leisure time, but unfortunately, the Gmail popup on my mobile phone about the class schedule that is of Academic Skills and Team Based Learning workshop session has been changed to 11:00 AM and I moved to my next class to take my workshop session with Mr. Manish Deuja.</p>
    <p>At Friday, there was a lecture session of Fundamentals of Computing where we learned about different Gates types. After that there was a short break. In the break time, I practice various gates types and I moved to the next class i.e. Introductory Programming and Problem Solving. In this session I learned about loops. I practiced it and it is very easy to learn. </p>
    <p>After college ends, I went to perform at Kamaladi. There I got a lot of chances to learn new things. Many audiences appreciate my singing ability there and I became very happy. Glimpse of my performance at kamaladi is attached below;
        After performing I was excited for my convocation ceremony at my old college i.e. Trinity International College. I am again going to perform there as well. </p>
        <p>Finally, the day came. I was really excited to meet my old friends as well as teachers. I leave from my home to college at 1:33 PM. I meet my friends on the way and we moved to our college. As we reach there, my friends planned to enter inside the college in VIP way. I was on CRF motorbike and my friends were on Bullet as well as on Cars. I decided to be on center and my friends were beside me. After that we entered inside the college in a grand way. Inside my college there were other friends who were waiting for us. As they see me, they howl like a jackal. After that we moved nearer to stage and enjoyed performance as well as Token of Love distribution ceremony. Finally, my turn came to perform there and I moved to stage and perform. I enjoyed there a lot. After performing, we went to Cafeteria and sit on the table. As I sit on the table, my friends treats me like VIP and they served snacks for me. We ate a lot of foods and went back to the stage. There I meet my old teachers and cracked some jokes as well. I told them their funny pet names that we used to call. After listening their names, they laughed loudly. We discussed about the new college that I joined as well as about the courses as well. I had a lot of fun there and after the program ends I said bye to all my teachers and friends and I returned back my home. Graduation Ceremony picture is attached below; </p>
